# pomodoro-timer-helper

Please implement a basic Pomodoro timer website with the following features:

- A prominent 25 minute countdown timer in the center of the page
- A large "Start" button below the timer. When clicked, it should start the countdown. While the timer is running, the button should say "Pause" instead, and clicking it should pause the timer. 
- A "Reset" button next to the Start/Pause button. When clicked, it should reset the timer back to 25:00.
- A heading at the top of the page saying "Pomodoro Timer"
- Use Chakra UI components and style the page in a clean and functional way
